# Infinum Dock

The Infinum Dock is a docking station for your smartphone. Essentially turning your smartphone into a fully featured laptop.

It boasts a full display/Keyboard/ and a battery to charge your smartphone and power the display. 

Why we made this?

Simple, broadband has it's limitations. Many communties are out of Telecoms broadband reach, and until that population
actually grows, there won't be broadband until it is economically feesible.

Those same communties are more often than not covered by a cellular provider one way or another (Often times the same telecom that can't connect to them in the broadband way).

So the solution? Leverage celluar connections in a meaningful way

A smartphone has the computing power to do what we want it to do, access the internet, 'text' word documents, edit files.
But it just does not have the right form factor

And that's what we solve here with this project, form factor. 

The crux of the issue is the Digital Divide, during covid, millions of students went home with chrome-bricks (yes, I said bricks)
because thats about how usefule they where. 

Student's who didn't have internet access at home couldn't even login to their chrome-bricks because they needed server access. Essentially making them bricks.

Now, we can 3D print this dock, go shopping for a few electronics, and spend a hour or such assembling it and Bam, a student now has access to the internet
wherever they may go. 

We are currently working with cellular providers as well as makerspaces to work with teachers to provide to childern who need it the most.
